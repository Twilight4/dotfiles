# If default credentials do not work to access a BMC, we can turn to a flaw
# in the RAKP protocol in IPMI 2.0. During the authentication process,
# the server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client
# before authentication takes place. This can be leveraged to obtain the password
# hash for ANY valid user account on the BMC. These password hashes can then be
# cracked offline using a dictionary attack using Hashcat mode 7300. In the event
# of an HP iLO using a factory default password, we can use this Hashcat mask attack command:
# hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 '?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1' -1 '?d?u'  # tries all combinations of upper case letters and numbers for an eight-character password
# or
# hashcat -m 7300 -w 3 -O ipmi.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

# To retrieve IPMI hashes, we can use the Metasploit IPMI 2.0 RAKP Remote SHA1 Password Hash Retrieval module.
