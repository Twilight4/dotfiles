Informational:
The modules are grouped under multiple categories, such as discovery, import, recon and reporting.
Modules, which require a key, we can tell from the "*" under the "K" column. This requirement indicates that this module is not usable unless we have a key to use the related service.
Other modules have dependencies, indicated by a "*" under the "D" column. Dependencies show that third-party Python libraries might be necessary to use the related module.
