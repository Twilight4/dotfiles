# Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) - 3389 port
# RDP is a protocol developed by Microsoft for remote access to a computer running the Windows operating system. This protocol allows
# display and control commands to be transmitted via the GUI encrypted over IP networks. Remote Desktop can be activated using the 
# Server Manager and comes with the default setting to allow connections to the service only to hosts with Network level authentication (NLA).

# Footprinting
# We can see that the RDP cookies (mstshash=nmap) used by Nmap to interact with the RDP server can be
# identified by threat hunters and various security services such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
# and can lock us out as penetration testers on hardened networks.


# We can connect to RDP servers on Linux using xfreerdp, rdesktop, or Remmina and interact with the GUI of the server accordingly.
