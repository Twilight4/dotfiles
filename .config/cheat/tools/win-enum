  netstat -abno           Get various information, such as which ports, which connections, and who is using them
  arp -a                  Helps you discover other systems on the same LAN that recently communicated with your system and
                          shows the current ARP entries, i.e., the physical addresses of the systems on the same LAN that communicated with your system

  -o           Display the process ID (PID)

Some of the information we are interested in gathering include:
  Users and groups
  Hostnames
  Routing tables
  Network shares
  Network services
  Applications and banners
  Firewall configurations
  Service settings and audit configurations
  SNMP and DNS details
  Hunting for credentials (saved on web browsers or client applications)

Domain Name System (DNS):
  dig -t AXFR DOMAIN_NAME @DNS_SERVER                  If we can get a “copy” of all the records that a DNS server is responsible
                                                       for answering, we might discover hosts we didn’t know existed.
                                                       Depending on the DNS server configuration, DNS zone transfer might be restricted.
                                                       If it is not restricted, it should be achievable using the herein command.
                                                       
Options:
  -t AXFR     Indicates that we are requesting a zone transfer,
  @           Precedes the `DNS_SERVER` that we want to query regarding the records related to the specified `DOMAIN_NAME`.

Server Message Block (SMB):
  net share   Check shared folders. For example we could see that `C:\Internal Files` is shared under the name "Internal"

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP):
  ./snmpcheck.rb TARGET_IP -c COMMUNITY_STRING 
              Simple tool to query servers related to SNMP
