# Aquatone is a tool for automatic and visual inspection of websites across many hosts
# and is convenient for quickly gaining an overview of HTTP-based attack surfaces 
# by scanning a list of configurable ports, visiting the website with a headless
# Chrome browser, and taking and screenshot.


# When it finishes, we will have a file called aquatone_report.html where we
# can see screenshots, technologies identified, server response headers, and HTML.
