John - advanced offline password cracker
Source: https://github.com/openwall/john

Commands:
  john --wordlist=/tmp/single-password-list.txt --rules=best64 --stdout | wc -l
                                                            Rule-Based attack

Options:
  --rules             Specify which rule or rules to use
  --rules=best64      best64 rule, which contains the best 64 built-in John rules
  --wordlist          Specify the wordlist or dictionary file.
  --stdout            Print the output to the terminal
  --format            The format the hash is in. if you're dealing with a standard hash type,
                      e.g. MD5 you have to prefix it with "raw-" to tell john you're just
                      dealing with a standard hash type
  --list=formats | grep -iF "md5"
                      Check if you need "raw-" to add the prefix or not
  --single            Lets john know you want to use the single hash cracking mode
                      

Single mode:
  In this mode, John uses only the information provided in the username,
  to try and work out possible passwords heuristically, by slightly changing
  the letters and numbers contained within the username (word mangling).
  If you're cracking hashes in single crack mode, you need to change the
  file format that you're feeding john for it to understand what data
  to create a wordlist from. You do this by prepending the hash with
  the username that the hash belongs to:
    from: 1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033
    to: mike:1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033

Custom Rules:
  sudo vi /etc/john/john.conf

Create a custom wordlist from a pre-existing dictionary 
with custom modification to the original dictionary. 
Add special characters in format: [symbols]word[0-9]
```
[List.Rules:custom-rule]
Az"[0-9]" ^[!@#$]
cAz"[0-9] [!£$%@]"
```
  john --wordlist=/tmp/single.lst --rules=custom-rule --stdout
                                Try out the newly created rule

Custom Rules Options:
  [List.Rules:THM-Password-Attacks]
              Specify the rule name THM-Password-Attacks
  Az          Takes the word and appends it with the characters you define
  ^           ^ means the beginning of the line/word. Note, changing `^` to `$` will append
              the special characters to the end of the line/word
  A0          Takes the word and prepends it with the characters you define
  c           Capitalises the character positionally
  [0-9]       Will include numbers 0-9
  [0]         Will include only the number 0
  [A-z]       Will include both upper and lowercase
  [A-Z]       Will include only uppercase letters
  [a-z]       Will include only lowercase letters
  [a]         Will include only a
  [!£$%@]     Will include the symbols !£$%@

Informational:
  Rule-Based attacks aka hybrid attacks assume the attacker knows something about the
  password policy. Rules are applied to create passwords within the guidelines of the
  given password policy and should, in theory, only generate valid passwords.
  Using pre-existing wordlists may be useful when generating passwords that fit 
  a policy — manipulating or 'mangling' a password such as 'password': `p@ssword`, `Pa$$word`, `Passw0rd`, and so on.

  "KoreLogic" rule uses various built-in and custom rules to generate complex password lists
