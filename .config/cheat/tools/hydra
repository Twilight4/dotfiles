POST Web Form Brute Force:
  hydra -l <USERNAME> -P <WORDLIST> <TARGET_IP> http-post-form "<PATH>:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=<INVALID_RESPONSE>" -vV

Options:
  -l                       Specify a single username 
  -L                       Use username wordlist
  -p                       Specify a single password
  -P                       Path specifying the full path of wordlist
  -t                       Number of parallel connections per target
  -v                       Verbose output
  -V                       Verbose output for every attempt
  -vV                      Sets verbose mode to very verbose, shows the login+pass combination for each attempt
  http-post-form           The type of the form is POST
  <PATH>                   The login page URL, for example: login.php
  <LOGIN_CREDENTIALS>      The username and password used to log in, for example: username=^USER^&password=^PASS^
  <INVALID_RESPONSE>       Part of the response when the login fails

FTP Brute Force:
  hydra -l ftp -P <PASSLIST_TXT> ftp://TARGET_IP -v

GET Web Form Brute Force Example:
  hydra -l phillips -P ~/john.txt <TARGET_IP> http-get-form "/login-get/index.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:S=logout.php" -f -v

Options:
  ftp://TARGET_IP          Protocol and the IP address or the fully qualified domain name (FDQN) of the target
  http-get-form            Type of HTTP request, which can be either `http-get-form` or `http-post-form`
  login-get/index.php      Path of the login page on the target webserver
  username=^USER^&password=^PASS^   Parameters to brute-force, we inject `^USER^` to brute force
                                    usernames and `^PASS^` for passwords from the specified dictionary
  F=incorrect              This section is important to eliminate false positives by specifying the 'failed' condition
  S=logout.php             Success condition to identify the valid credentials
  -f                       Stop the brute-forcing attacks after finding a valid username and password

Commands:
  hydra http-get-form -U   Check hydra options for the http-get-form

Informational:
  What you set for these `S=` and `F=` values depends on the response you receive back from the server for a failed login attempt and a successful login attempt.
  For example, if you receive a message on the webpage 'Invalid password' after a failed login, set `F=`Invalid Password.

  Or for example, during the enumeration, we found that the webserver serves `logout.php`. After logging into the login page with valid credentials,
  we could guess that we will have `logout.php` somewhere on the page. Therefore, we could tell hydra to look for the text `logout.php` within the HTML for every request.

  Password spraying attack targets many usernames using one common weak password, which could help avoid an account lockout policy. Common and weak passwords often follow a pattern and format:
	- The current **season** followed by the current **year** (SeasonYear). For example, Fall2020, Spring2021, etc.
	- The current **month** followed by the current **year** (MonthYear). For example, November2020, March2021, etc.
	- Using the company **name** along with random **numbers** (CompanyNameNumbers). For example, TryHackMe01, TryHackMe02.
