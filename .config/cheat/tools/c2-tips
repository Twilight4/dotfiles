Pentesting frameworks, such as Cobalt Strike and Empire, offer malleable Command and Control (C2) profiles. These profiles allow various fine-tuning to evade IDS/IPS systems. If you are using such a framework, it is worth creating a custom profile instead of relying on a default one. Examples variables you can control include the following:
  User-Agent: The tool or framework you are using can expose you via its default-set user-agent. Hence, it is always important to set the user-agent to something innocuous and test to confirm your settings.
  Sleep Time: The sleep time allows you to control the callback interval between beacon check-ins. In other words, you can control how often the infected system will attempt to connect to the control system.
  Jitter: This variable lets you add some randomness to the sleep time, specified by the jitter percentage. A jitter of 30% results in a sleep time of ±30% to further evade detection.
  SSL Certificate: Using your authentic-looking SSL certificate will significantly improve your chances of evading detection. It is a very worthy investment of time.
  DNS Beacon: Consider the case where you are using DNS protocol to exfiltrate data. You can fine-tune DNS beacons by setting the DNS servers and the hostname in the DNS query. The hostname will be holding the exfiltrated data.
