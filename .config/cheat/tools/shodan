To use Shodan from the command-line properly, you need to create an account
with https://www.shodan.io/, then configure shodan to use your API key using
the command, `shodan init API_KEY`. Example of looking up information about 
one of the IP addresses we got from `nslookup cafe.thmredteam.com`. 
Using `shodan host IP_ADDRESS`, we can get the geographical location of the
IP address and the open ports.

We can learn several things related to our search, such as:
  IP address 
  hosting company 
  geographic location 
  server type and version
